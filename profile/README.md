![tp header](/doc/img/Asam_Background_1.jpg)

ASAM OSI® (Open Simulation Interface) is a standard released by [ASAM e.V.](https://asam.net). It is a specification for interfaces between models and components of a distributed simulation. OSI is strongly focused on the environmental perception of automated driving functions.

## About ASAM

ASAM e.V. (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) is a non-profit organization that promotes standardization of tool chains in automotive development and testing. Our members are international car manufacturers, suppliers, tool vendors, engineering service providers, and research institutes. ASAM standards are developed by experts from our member companies and are based on real use cases. ASAM is the legal owner of these standards and is responsible for their distribution and marketing.

ASAM provides support in connecting members, coordinating work groups, and developing, releasing, and maintaining standards. Our active community includes more than 400 member organizations around the world. These members ensure that ideas with market relevance will progress into standards and that these standards are used worldwide. 

The standards developed at ASAM span a wide range of use cases in automotive development, test, and Validation. They define file formats, data models, protocols, and interfaces. All ASAM standards aim to enable easy exchange of data and tools within and across tool chains. They are applied worldwide.
